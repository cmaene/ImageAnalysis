### Octave
![output_example](output_example.png)Support Vector Machine classification example (classification.sh) with LIBSVM. Turned out LIBSVM was easier to run in Bash, so I didn't use Octave interface, except that I use Octave to prepare data (preparedata.m) and to create the predicted image with the prediction result/array (predict2grid.m).

#### Steps
All steps are in "classification.sh"...
